# iota

Iota is yet another QOL/tweaks mod, adding a few things to the game that we thought should have been there in the first place. Yep, one of those.

## Notable features
More information on these features and how to use them will be available in the wiki.

### Tweaks

* Villagers, wandering traders and turtles can now be leashed.
* Villagers and wandering traders now follow players holding emeralds.
* Parrots now follow players holding any `forge:seeds` item, much faster than their normal flight speed.
* Snow golems now follow players holding snowballs, slightly faster than their normal walking speed.
* Cows, mooshrooms, pigs, chickens, rabbits and sheep now follow players holding their respective food items 30% fasterâ€”no more waiting around for your farm animals to catch up!

### Integration

* Resource-driven [JEI item info](https://blamejared.com/docsImages/JEITweakerAddInfo.png): pack makers can simply add item information keys to a loaded lang file, and they'll be integrated with JEI! This can be done via plain old resource packs or by loading them with one of KubeJS, ResourceLoader etc.
